# Create React Folder Component

A simple wizard that speeds up creating new React folder components.



This extension is very bare-bones but opinionated on how a component directory should be structured.

See the screenshots further down for examples.

## Features

This extension provides two commands, accessible in the explorer context menu and in the command palette.

Command palette:
![Command palette commands](images/command-palette.png)

Explorer context menu:
![Context menu commands](images/context-menu.png)

When activated it will prompt you to give your component a name:
![Name component](images/name-component.png)

The extension will then create a folder and files for a new component with your given name:
![Component structure](images/created-component.png)

With styles:
![Component structure with style](images/created-styled-component.png)

The contents of those files will be (without style):
![Component content](images/component-contents.png)
![Index content](images/index-contents.png)
